Purify DNA using centrifuge
1. Add a 1:1 volume of Binding Buffer to complete PCR reaction mixture. Mix thoroughly.
Note: For example, for 100 μL of PCR reaction mixture, add 100 μL of Binding Buffer.
2. If the color of the solution is orange or violet, add 10 μL of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2 solution,
then mix.
Note: The color of the mix will become yellow. A yellow color indicates an optimal pH for DNA
binding.
3. (Optional) If the DNA fragment is ≤500 bp, add a 1:2 volume of 100% isopropanol. Mix thoroughly.
Note: For example, 100 μL of isopropanol should be added to the 100 μL PCR reaction mixture
combined with 100 μL of Binding Buffer.
Note: If the PCR reaction mixture contains primer-dimers, purification without isopropanol is
recommended. However, the yield of the target DNA fragment will be lower.
4. Transfer up to 800 μL of the solution from step 1 (or optional step 2) to the purification column.
Centrifuge at >12,000 × g for 30–60 seconds. Discard the flow-through.
Note: If the total volume exceeds 800 μL, the solution can be added to the column in stages. After
the addition of 800 μL of solution, centrifuge the column at >12,000 × g for 30–60 seconds, then
discard flow-through. Repeat until the entire solution has been added to the column membrane.
5. Add 700 μL of Wash Buffer supplemented with ethanol (see “Before first use of the kit” on page 6)
to the purification column.
6. Centrifuge at >12,000 × g for 30–60 seconds. Discard the flow-through, then place the purification
column back into the collection tube.
7. Centrifuge the empty purification column at >12,000 × g for1 minute to completely remove any
residual wash buffer.
IMPORTANT! This step is essential as the presence of residual ethanol in the DNA sample may
inhibit subsequent reactions.
8. Transfer the purification column to a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.

GeneJET™ PCR Purification Kit User Guide 79. Add 50 μL of Elution Buffer to the center of the purification column membrane. Centrifuge at >
12,000 × g for 1 minute. Discard the purification column.
Note:
· For low DNA amounts the elution volumes can be reduced to increase DNA concentration. An
elution volume between 20–50 μL does not significantly reduce the DNA yield. However, elution
volumes less than 10 μL are not recommended.
· If DNA fragment is >10 kb, prewarm Elution Buffer to 65°C before applying to column.
· If the elution volume is 10 μL and DNA amount is ≥5 μg, incubate column for 1 minute at room
temperature before centrifugation

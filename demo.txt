**Step 1: Tissue Homogenization**
- Weigh 100 mg of fresh Arabidopsis leaves and place in a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube.
- Add 500 µL of Lysis Buffer(CTAB-based, containing 2% CTAB, 100 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM EDTA, 1.4 M NaCl) and 10 µL of RNase A (10 mg/mL).
- Vortex vigorously for 30 sec until the tissue is fully disrupted.

**Step 2: Incubation & Protein Removal**
- Incubate the mixture at 65°C for 10 min in a water bath.
- Add 500 µL of Chloroform:Isoamyl Alcohol (24:1) and mix by inversion for 5 min.
- Centrifuge at 12,000 × *g* for 5 min. Transfer the aqueous (top) phase to a new tube.

**Step 3: DNA Precipitation**
- Add 0.7 volumes of Isopropanol and mix gently. Incubate at -20°C for 30 min.
- Centrifuge at 12,000 × *g* for 10 min to pellet DNA. Discard the supernatant.

**Step 4: Washing & Elution**
- Wash the pellet with 500 µL of 70% Ethanol, then centrifuge at 12,000 × *g* for 2 min. Air-dry for 5 min.
- Resuspend the DNA in 50 µL of Elution Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) and transfer to a DNA spin column.
- Centrifuge at 12,000 × *g* for 1 min to collect purified DNA.

**Step 5: Quantification**
- Measure DNA concentration using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer at 260 nm.
- Store DNA at -20°C for long-term use.
